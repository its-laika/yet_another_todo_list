## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you want to report a vulnerability, check if it's possible to create an issue without endangering other users.
If that's not the case, send a mail to the address on my ([neon-JS](https://github.com/neon-JS)) profile.
I check my mails pretty frequently so expect a reply within a few days. From there on, I'll do my best to fix the vulnerability asap.
If you want to, you can also provide patches directly or via pull requests. A new version is pushed as soon as the vulnerability is fixed.
